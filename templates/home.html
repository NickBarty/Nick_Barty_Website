            HECS debt can be hard to understand, but it shouldn't be.<br>
            The following are facts about HECS debt:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HECS Debt is indexed <b>annually on June 1</b></li>
            <li><u>'Indexation'</u> is the same as interest on a loan, just different terminology</li>
            <li>Only HECS debt you have had for <b>more than 1 year</b> has indexation applied to it</li>
            <li>You only make automatic repayments on a HECS debt when your <b>annual income is above a certain amount</b></li>
            <li>In the vast majority of cases, making even a <b>$10 weekly voluntary contribution</b> towards your debt will <b>save you years and thousands of dollars</b> in the long run</li>
        </ul>
